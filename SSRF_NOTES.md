### SSRF with blacklist-based input filters

Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using the following techniques:

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.


### SSRF with whitelist-based input filters

Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the beginning of the input, or contained within in it. You may be able to bypass this filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are likely to be overlooked when URLs implement ad-hoc parsing and validation using this method:

- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the `@` character. For example:
    
    `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example:
    
    `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example:
    
    `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try [double-encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/essential-skills/obfuscating-attacks-using-encodings#obfuscation-via-double-url-encoding) characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive, which can lead to further discrepancies.
- You can use combinations of these techniques together.
